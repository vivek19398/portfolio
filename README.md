# Vivek Ranjan — Dual-Universe Personal Site

A cinematic two-galaxy personal site: visitors land on a cosmic **gateway** (`/`) and choose between the **Work Universe** (`/work` — AI & Data Engineering portfolio) and the **Travel Galaxy** (`/travel` — Instagram-style travel blog, stories, hacks, and personal writing). Powered by **React + TypeScript + Tailwind + Framer Motion** and **Supabase** (PostgreSQL, Auth, Storage, RLS).

> Both universes render fully even **without** Supabase configured (clearly-marked local fallback content). Connect Supabase to make everything database-editable, enable the contact form, admin dashboard, and real travel media.

## Routes

| Route | Experience |
|---|---|
| `/` | Galaxy gateway — choose your universe |
| `/work` | Portfolio (hero, skills, experience, projects, contact) |
| `/travel` | Travel home (highlights, featured trips, gallery preview) |
| `/travel/gallery` | Masonry photo/video gallery with filters + lightbox |
| `/travel/stories`, `/travel/stories/:slug` | Travel stories |
| `/travel/hacks`, `/travel/hacks/:slug` | Searchable travel hacks |
| `/blog`, `/blog/:slug` | Personal blog |
| `/admin` | Admin dashboard (portfolio + travel content) |

## Quick start (local)

```bash
npm install
cp .env.example .env        # optional — site works without it
npm run dev                 # http://localhost:5173
```

Production build:

```bash
npm run build               # outputs to dist/
npm run preview             # serve the production build locally
```

---

## 1. Supabase setup

1. Create a free project at [supabase.com](https://supabase.com) (choose a region near your visitors, e.g. `eu-west-1`).
2. Open **SQL Editor** and run the seven migration files **in order**:
   1. `supabase/migrations/001_create_tables.sql` — portfolio schema
   2. `supabase/migrations/002_enable_rls.sql`
   3. `supabase/migrations/003_create_policies.sql`
   4. `supabase/migrations/004_seed_initial_data.sql` — resume seed data
   5. `supabase/migrations/005_create_travel_tables.sql` — travel blog schema
   6. `supabase/migrations/006_travel_rls_policies.sql`
   7. `supabase/migrations/007_travel_storage_buckets.sql` — storage buckets + policies
3. Create the **admin user**: **Authentication → Users → Add user** → enter your email + a strong password → check *Auto confirm user*.
4. **Disable public sign-ups** (critical — the RLS policies treat any authenticated user as admin):
   **Authentication → Sign In / Up → disable "Allow new users to sign up"**.
5. Copy credentials from **Project Settings → API**:
   - Project URL → `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`
   - `anon` `public` key → `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`

   ⚠️ Never use the `service_role` key anywhere in this project — it bypasses RLS.

### Travel media workflow — direct upload from /admin

Photos and covers upload **directly from the admin dashboard** — no Supabase dashboard needed, no manual compression:

1. `/admin` → **Travel Media** → **+ Add** → click (or drag a file onto) **"Upload photo or video"**.
   - **Images** are compressed in your browser to WebP (~1600px full size → `travel-media`, ~420px thumbnail → `travel-thumbnails`) and `media_type`, `public_url`, `thumbnail_url`, `storage_path` are filled automatically. Typical result: ~100–300 KB full + ~20–40 KB thumb.
   - **Videos** upload as-is to `travel-media` (50 MB hard cap; aim for under ~8 MB — e.g. HandBrake, H.264 720p). Add a thumbnail image with the field's own Upload button.
2. Fill in caption, location, country/city, tags, destination ID (copy the uuid from the Destinations list), mark Featured if it should appear on the travel home → **Save**.
3. Every **cover image** field (Destinations, Stories, Hacks, Blog Posts, Highlights) has the same **⤒ Upload image** button with a live preview — it compresses and uploads to the right bucket and fills the URL for you.
4. Add **Destinations** first (their uuids link media/highlights), then everything else. Sample placeholder content disappears automatically once real rows exist.

Uploads use your authenticated admin session — the storage RLS policies reject anonymous uploads, so this only works while logged into `/admin`. The public site only ever *reads* storage.

The grid always renders thumbnails; full-size media loads only inside the lightbox, gallery pages load 12 items at a time with infinite scroll, and videos never autoplay.

### Resume file

The resume is served as a static asset at `public/Vivek_Ranjan_Resume.pdf` (already included — zero queries, free, cached by the CDN). To serve it from Supabase Storage instead: create a **public bucket** `assets`, upload the PDF, copy its public URL, and update `resume_url` in the `profile` table via `/admin` or SQL.

## 2. Frontend deployment

### Option A — Vercel (recommended)

1. Push this repo to GitHub:
   ```bash
   git init && git add -A && git commit -m "Initial portfolio"
   git remote add origin https://github.com/my-profile/portfolio.git
   git push -u origin main
   ```
2. [vercel.com](https://vercel.com) → **Add New Project** → import the repo.
   Vercel auto-detects Vite: build command `npm run build`, output `dist`.
3. **Environment Variables** (Project → Settings → Environment Variables):
   | Name | Value |
   |---|---|
   | `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` | `https://your-project-ref.supabase.co` |
   | `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` | your anon key |
4. Deploy. SPA routing for `/admin` is handled by `vercel.json`.

### Option B — Netlify

Same flow at [netlify.com](https://netlify.com): build command `npm run build`, publish directory `dist`, add the two env vars. SPA routing is handled by `public/_redirects`.

### Option C — Cloudflare Pages

[pages.cloudflare.com](https://pages.cloudflare.com) → connect repo → framework preset **Vite** → add the two env vars (set them for Production *and* Preview). `_redirects` works here too.

> After changing env vars on any platform, **redeploy** — Vite inlines them at build time.

---

## 3. Custom domain + DNS

Using placeholders `mydomain.com` / `hello@mydomain.com` — replace with your real values.

### Connect the domain (Vercel example)

1. Vercel → Project → **Settings → Domains** → add `mydomain.com` and `www.mydomain.com`.
2. At your DNS provider add:

   | Type | Name | Value | Purpose |
   |---|---|---|---|
   | `A` | `@` | `76.76.21.21` | apex → Vercel |
   | `CNAME` | `www` | `cname.vercel-dns.com` | www → Vercel |

   (Netlify: `A @ 75.2.60.5` + `CNAME www your-site.netlify.app`. Cloudflare Pages: `CNAME` both to `your-project.pages.dev`.)
3. Wait for DNS propagation (minutes–48h). Vercel provisions HTTPS automatically.
4. Set `www` → apex redirect (or vice versa) in the Domains panel — pick one canonical form.

### Keep your domain email working

Your domain email (`hello@mydomain.com`) is **independent of the website** — it's controlled by `MX` records. Pointing `A`/`CNAME` records at Vercel does **not** affect email, as long as you don't delete these existing records:

| Type | Name | Keep as-is |
|---|---|---|
| `MX` | `@` | your mail provider's mail servers |
| `TXT` | `@` | SPF record (`v=spf1 …`) |
| `TXT` | `*._domainkey` | DKIM keys |
| `TXT` | `_dmarc` | DMARC policy |

After updating site DNS, send yourself a test email to confirm nothing broke.

### Update placeholders after the domain is live

- `index.html` — canonical/OG URLs
- `public/robots.txt`, `public/sitemap.xml`
- `profile` table (`email`, `linkedin_url`, `github_url`) via `/admin`

## 4. Contact form — behavior & testing

**Flow:** validate (length + email format) → sanitize (strips `<>` and control chars) → honeypot check → insert into `contact_messages` via the anon key (allowed by RLS insert policy) → cinematic success state. Database `CHECK` constraints enforce the same limits server-side.

**Email notifications (optional):** messages are *always* stored in Supabase. To also get an email per message, the clean path is a Supabase **Database Webhook** (Database → Webhooks → on `INSERT` into `contact_messages`) pointing at a Supabase Edge Function that calls [Resend](https://resend.com) (free tier: 100 emails/day) or SendGrid. Keep the API key in the Edge Function's secrets — never in the frontend. EmailJS is a frontend-only alternative if you prefer zero backend code.

### Test checklist

1. **Validation:** submit empty form → inline errors; bad email (`foo@bar`) → email error.
2. **Happy path:** valid submission → glowing "Message received" appears; Supabase → Table Editor → `contact_messages` shows the row with `is_read = false`.
3. **Privacy:** in an incognito tab, run in the browser console on your site:
   ```js
   const { data, error } = await window.__sb?.from?.('contact_messages').select('*')
   ```
   — or simpler: confirm in the dashboard that the `anon` role has no select policy. Public reads must return an empty result/error.
4. **Honeypot:** bots that fill the hidden "Company" field get a fake success and nothing is stored.
5. **Admin:** log into `/admin` → Messages tab → the message appears; mark read / delete.
6. **Unconfigured backend:** with no env vars the form shows a graceful "email me directly" error.

---

## 5. Admin dashboard (`/admin`)

1. Visit `https://mydomain.com/admin` → sign in with the Supabase user you created.
2. Tabs: **Messages** (read/unread/delete) and full add/edit/delete for **Projects, Skills, Experience, Education, Achievements, Certifications**.
3. List-type fields (tech stack, achievements, impact metrics) are edited **one item per line**.
4. Content changes are visible to visitors after their 10-minute cache expires (or immediately in a fresh tab).
5. Sign out with the button in the header. `/admin` is excluded from search engines via `robots.txt`.

---

## 6. Security model

- **RLS enabled on all 9 tables**; default-deny, opened only by explicit policies.
- Public role: `SELECT` on content tables, `INSERT`-only on `contact_messages` and `site_analytics_events`. No public read of messages/analytics, no public update/delete anywhere.
- Authenticated role = admin (sign-ups disabled) → full content CRUD.
- Anon key only in the browser; service key never. Env vars via platform settings, `.env` git-ignored.
- Input sanitization client-side **and** Postgres `CHECK` constraints server-side; React escapes output by default. Honeypot anti-spam.

## 7. Performance & SEO

- Below-the-fold sections lazy-loaded (`React.lazy`); vendor/motion/supabase split into separate chunks.
- One batched parallel fetch per visit, cached in `sessionStorage` for 10 min → minimal free-tier usage.
- Canvas particles capped (~70) and disabled-to-static under `prefers-reduced-motion`.
- Semantic HTML, labeled forms, keyboard-focus rings, accessible contrast.
- Meta description, Open Graph + Twitter cards, JSON-LD Person schema, `robots.txt`, `sitemap.xml`, favicon.

## 8. Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Fix |
|---|---|
| Site shows resume data but admin says "Supabase is not configured" | Env vars missing — set both `VITE_*` vars and **rebuild/redeploy** (they're baked in at build time). |
| `new row violates row-level security policy` on contact submit | `003_create_policies.sql` not run, or it ran before `002`. Re-run 002 then 003. |
| Admin login succeeds but every write fails | The "admin write" policies are missing — re-run `003_create_policies.sql`. |
| `/admin` gives 404 in production | SPA rewrite missing — ensure `vercel.json` (Vercel) or `public/_redirects` (Netlify/CF) deployed. |
| Anyone can sign up and edit content | Disable sign-ups: Supabase → Authentication → Sign In / Up. |
| Duplicate seed rows | You ran `004` twice. Truncate affected tables and re-run once: `truncate public.skills, public.projects, public.experience, public.education, public.achievements, public.profile cascade;` |
| Domain email stopped after DNS change | An `MX`/SPF `TXT` record was removed — restore your mail provider's records (section 3). |
| Stale content after editing in admin | 10-min `sessionStorage` cache — hard refresh or wait. |
| Fonts blocked / flash of unstyled text | Google Fonts is render-non-blocking by design; self-host fonts if you prefer (e.g. `@fontsource/cinzel`). |
